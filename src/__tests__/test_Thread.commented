import Thread from 'utils/algorithm/Thread';


Currently commented out while I work on other tests


/**
 * Skeleton for future tests of the Thread class. Right now, we cannot
 * test an algorithm running in Thread, because each call in the Thread
 * class is blocking. This means that the thread will not actually
 * run until we make a call to unblock it, and that is usually
 * done by a user on the frontend.

    /*
     * It would be possible to test an algorithm running in the Thread class,
     * but it would be difficult and cumbersome to do. We would need to wait
     * for the Thread to post a redraw message, which signifies that it's done
     * with it's step. When we get this message, we can use Atomics.notify to
     * wake it up, and make sure that the correct messages are passed with each
     * step. 
     *
     * This kind of testing has not yet been implemented, however.
